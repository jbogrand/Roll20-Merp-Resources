# Crititcal hit files
To use these will need the API from TheArron [Rollable Table Lookup](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/5659079/look-up-tables/?pageforid=5659297#post-5659297)
Since the rollable needs the lowest number to start at position 1 and go up the results on the table will not appear to match up.
To match them up with the charts in **MERP** subtract 50 from the weighted position.  Or a C crit which is a straight 1D100 roll on the chart is equivlant
to 1D100+50 roll on a roll lookup.  [These charts](https://github.com/jbogrand/Roll20-Merp-Resources/tree/main/Crit) do not work without the API.
